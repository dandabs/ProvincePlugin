Something unique to CloudCraft SMP is the other regions you can travel to. Near spawn, there is a train that you can walk into and you can select a region to travel to. This is useful if you have a friend in another region. I hope you enjoy CloudCraft as much as I do. Cheers, Hydroweaponx (HoD) (Founding Soto Monarch)");
